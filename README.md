# Professional Background Removal - GitHub Actions

🎯 **Commercial-grade background removal** powered by GitHub Actions for heavy processing workloads.

## 🚀 Features

- **Commercial Quality**: Advanced multi-model ensemble matching remove.bg quality
- **Heavy Processing**: Optimized for GitHub Actions with parallel batch processing
- **Multiple Quality Levels**: Fast, High, Ultra, and Commercial grade processing
- **Scalable**: Automatic batching for large image sets
- **Cloud-Based**: No local processing power required

## 📋 How to Use

### Method 1: Upload Images and Run Workflow

1. **Upload your images** to the repository:
   - Place images in the `input/` folder, or
   - Upload them directly to the root directory

2. **Run the workflow**:
   - Go to Actions tab in GitHub
   - Select "Professional Background Removal"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Choose quality level:
     - `fast`: Quick processing (~30s per image)
     - `high`: High quality (~60s per image)
     - `ultra`: Ultra quality (~90s per image)
     - `commercial`: Maximum quality (~120s per image)

3. **Download results**:
   - Check the completed workflow
   - Download `professional-background-removal-complete` artifact
   - Extract the ZIP file to get all processed images

### Method 2: Automatic Processing

Images uploaded to the repository automatically trigger processing when:
- Files are added to `input/` folder
- Image files (jpg, jpeg, png, webp) are pushed to the repo

## 🔧 Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Process single image
python true_commercial.py input.jpg --quality ultra

# Process with custom output
python true_commercial.py input.jpg -o output.png --quality commercial

# Batch processing to directory
python true_commercial.py input.jpg --output-dir output/ --quality high
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Quality Levels Explained

- **Fast**: Basic U²-Net model with minimal post-processing
- **High**: Enhanced model with edge refinement
- **Ultra**: Multi-model ensemble with advanced matting
- **Commercial**: Full commercial pipeline with hair/fur enhancement

### Batch Processing

The workflow automatically:
- Detects number of images
- Splits into batches (default: 10 images per batch)
- Processes batches in parallel (max 3 concurrent)
- Consolidates results into single download

### Workflow Inputs

- `quality_level`: Processing quality (fast/high/ultra/commercial)
- `batch_size`: Images per batch (default: 10, max recommended: 20)

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combines U²-Net, ISNet, and specialized models
2. **Advanced Alpha Matting**: Commercial-grade trimap generation and solving
3. **Edge Refinement**: Multi-scale edge detection and enhancement
4. **Hair/Fur Enhancement**: Specialized processing for fine details
5. **Post-Processing**: Color correction, noise reduction, and smoothing

### Performance

- **Processing Time**: 30-120 seconds per image (quality dependent)
- **Concurrent Jobs**: Up to 3 parallel batches
- **Memory Usage**: ~4GB per batch
- **Storage**: 90-day artifact retention

## 📊 Results Quality

This system achieves **commercial-grade results** comparable to:
- Remove.bg Professional API
- Photoshop's Subject Selection + Refine Edge
- Professional photo editing services

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow timeout**: Reduce batch size or quality level
2. **Memory errors**: Use smaller batches (5-8 images)
3. **Poor results**: Try higher quality level or check image resolution

### Supported Formats

- **Input**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WebP
- **Output**: PNG with transparency
- **Resolution**: Up to 4K (larger images auto-resized)

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Personal Projects
- Remove backgrounds from photos
- Create product images for e-commerce
- Generate profile pictures

### Professional Use
- Batch process product catalogs
- Create marketing materials
- Prepare images for web/print

### Bulk Processing
- Process hundreds of images overnight
- Consistent quality across large datasets
- No local hardware requirements
